Tracy Retreat Quote Contract.pdf
PDF
write the process and the best companies to quote tracy for her wellness retreat cancelation insurance and the sign up sheets that require the non-refundable payments from the attendees that will minimize her risk at organizing the event at Lula Resort in March 2026 using the proposal she got from them (attached)  and including suggesting the right kind of travel insurance for each participant to buy for themselves
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a full plan for minimizing Tracy’s financial and liability risk in organizing her March 2026 Lula Resort wellness retreat, based on the contract terms you shared and best practices for retreat organizers:

1. Organizer Risk Coverage (Tracy’s Insurance)
a. Retreat Cancellation & Liability Insurance
Tracy should purchase a Retreat Organizer Insurance Policy that covers:

Retreat cancellation/postponement (due to weather, pandemic resurgence, natural disasters, resort closure, or other uncontrollable factors).

Deposits and prepaid costs (the Lula contract requires a non-refundable $2,000 deposit plus staged payments).

General liability (covers accidents, property damage, or injuries during activities you organize).

Professional liability (covers Tracy as a certified wellness coach and organizer in case a client claims harm from advice or programming).

Best companies for retreat/camp/conference insurance:

Event Helper (eventhelper.com) – widely used, covers retreats, yoga/wellness events.

Philadelphia Insurance Companies (phly.com) – specializes in fitness, wellness, and retreat event insurance.

AIG Travel Guard – Group/Organizer Plans – covers organizer liability and retreat cancellation.

Beazley / Lloyd’s Syndicate underwriters (often accessed via a broker like Marsh or HUB International).

InsureMyRetreat.com (a boutique broker focused on yoga/wellness retreats).

👉 Recommendation: Work with a broker such as HUB International or Marsh McLennan to source multiple quotes from AIG, Beazley, and Philadelphia Insurance to get the broadest coverage.

2. Attendee Risk Coverage (Participant Responsibility)
Each participant should be required to purchase individual travel insurance that includes:

Trip cancellation/interruption (illness, family emergency, job change, travel delays).

Medical coverage abroad (including accidents, emergency evacuation from Mexico).

Cancel For Any Reason (CFAR) – optional but strongly recommended for maximum flexibility.

Recommended insurers for participants:

Allianz Travel Insurance (easy to buy, reliable claims process).

Travel Guard by AIG (widely recognized, flexible options).

IMG (International Medical Group) (strong for health + evacuation coverage).

Seven Corners (good for group and wellness travel).

World Nomads (popular with wellness/yoga travelers, covers activities).

👉 Tracy can provide attendees with a short list + links and require proof of insurance at registration.

3. Sign-Up Sheets & Payment Structure (Minimizing Tracy’s Risk)
Tracy should collect payments in stages that align with Lula’s payment plan, ensuring she is never out of pocket:

a. Non-Refundable Deposit (from attendees)

Require $500–$1,000 per person non-refundable deposit at registration (covers Lula’s $2,000 non-refundable deposit and reserves their room).

Include clear language: “Deposits are non-refundable under any circumstances. We strongly recommend purchasing travel insurance with ‘Cancel For Any Reason’ coverage.”

b. Second Payment

Due by Dec 1, 2025 (aligns with Lula’s Dec 3 payment).

Amount: 30% of retreat cost. Non-refundable but transferable if participant finds replacement.

c. Final Payment

Due by Feb 1, 2026 (before Lula’s Feb 3 deadline).

Must be paid in full to keep spot. Non-refundable.

d. Attendee Agreement / Waiver
Sign-up form should include:

Non-refundable payment terms.

Requirement to purchase personal travel insurance (and provide proof).

Liability waiver (Tracy not responsible for accidents, travel disruptions, or cancellations).

Health acknowledgment (wellness retreat is not a substitute for medical care).

4. Suggested Workflow
Get quotes → Contact HUB International/Marsh to obtain retreat cancellation + liability insurance quotes (covering ~$40k prepaid costs).

Update registration form → Add deposit/payment schedule, non-refundable terms, insurance requirement, and waiver.

Communicate to attendees → Provide list of recommended travel insurance providers and stress importance of CFAR.

Collect deposits early (Oct 2025 latest) to secure Lula and align cash flow.

Track payments → Use an online system (HoneyBook, WeTravel, or Retreat.Guru) that automates invoices, reminders, and waiver collection.

✅ Next Step: I can draft the attendee sign-up/waiver form for Tracy with clear non-refundable payment language and insurance requirements.

Would you like me to prepare this as a fillable PDF form (ready for clients) or as a Word doc (that Tracy can edit)?

You said:
draft the sign/up waiver as a fillable PDF and prepare the information that wil be requested by the insurers as much as you can 
ChatGPT said:

Total prepaid costs ($39,109.25 from Lula quote).

Would you like me to expand the PDF into a fully interactive fillable version (so participants can type directly into fields), or keep it as a sign-and-scan form? 

You said:
use the specifics from the quote and add golf and that it is in Tulum Mexico
ChatGPT said:
Here’s the updated waiver with all specifics from the Lula contract, including Tulum, the prepaid costs, and golf:

📄 Download Tracy_Retreat_Signup_Waiver_Detailed.pdf

This version clearly states:

Retreat dates, location (Tulum, Mexico), and inclusions.

Exact Lula package costs ($39,109.25).

Activities (yoga, ice bath, salsa, canal float, golf transport, spa).

Non-refundable payment terms.

Travel insurance requirements.

Liability waiver aligned with activities.

Would you like me to add interactive fillable fields (so attendees can type in their info/signature digitally), or keep it as a print-sign version? 

You said:
digital signature please
ChatGPT said:
Here’s the fillable PDF version with text fields and a digital signature box so participants can complete it online:

📄 Download Tracy_Retreat_Signup_Waiver_Detailed_Fillable.pdf

This version allows:

Typing in name, email, phone, address, emergency contact.

Entering printed name & date.

Signing digitally in the signature field (works in Adobe Acrobat/Preview).

Do you also want me to add a field for uploading proof of insurance (like policy number / insurer name), or just keep that as a required email submission? 

You said:
add a field
ChatGPT said:
Here’s the finalized fillable waiver with digital signature AND an insurance proof field (for attendees to provide insurer + policy number):

📄 Download Tracy_Retreat_Signup_Waiver_Detailed_Fillable_Insurance.pdf

This version now allows:

Typing in all personal info.

Entering insurance provider & policy number.

Adding a digital signature directly.

Do you want me to also create a companion organizer checklist (with all the info insurers will request + dates for payments/deadlines) so Tracy can manage her risk more easily? 

You said:
Can you make the pdf more attractive and more like her Wellgevity brand
ChatGPT said:
Got it — right now the waiver PDF is functional but pretty bare. To bring it closer to Tracy’s Wellgevity brand, I can:

Add a clean branded header with “Wellgevity” logo/wordmark styling (modern sans-serif, wellness colors like teal/seafoam + soft gold accents).

Use a 2-tone design (light pastel background banners for section headers, white body with clean dividers).

Place a footer tagline like: “Wellgevity Wellness Retreats — Live Your Best Life”.

Use section boxes: Personal Info, Retreat Details, Payment Terms, Insurance, Waiver.

Keep fillable fields clearly outlined but styled.

Digital signature box with a softer border and “Click here to sign digitally.”

Since we don’t have Tracy’s official Wellgevity logo file, I can design the PDF to look “on brand” with fonts and color scheme she can later swap in her real logo.

👉 Before I re-generate: do you want me to create this styled PDF template with fillable fields (same fields as before), or would you prefer a Word version with brand styling that we then convert to a fillable PDF so it’s easier for her to edit branding later?

You said:
See her Tracy Hook website and use her branding there. Also make a feminine professional wellgevity logo that she can change later. this should be made as a landing page for her website

Amazing — I built you a polished, on-brand landing page and a lightweight Wellgevity wordmark you can swap later. It matches the tone and message on tracyhook.com (“Reclaim Your Joy…”) and highlights Tulum/Lula details, inclusions, insurance + waiver, and a styled sign-up form. 
Tracy Hook

I just put the page in the canvas (right pane) titled “Wellgevity Retreat Landing Page (Tracy • Lula 2026).” It’s a single-file React component with Tailwind that you can drop into your site.

Here’s what you’ve got:

A feminine, professional Wellgevity wordmark (editable SVG) and a soothing emerald/rose palette.

Hero + Retreat Details (Lula, Tulum; Mar 17–22, 2026), Inclusions, Payment Schedule, Insurance & Liability sections, and a Reserve Your Spot form with typed-signature and agreement checkbox.

A button that links directly to your fillable waiver PDF.

Downloads you can use now

Notes on branding

I matched the language, structure, and feel from your current website so this page slides right in stylistically. If you’d like me to extract your exact hex colors and type system from your live CSS and swap them into Tailwind tokens, I can do that. 
Tracy Hook

How to use this

Copy the React component from the canvas into your site/app.

Make sure Tailwind is enabled (the component is self-contained, no extra libs required).

Wire the “Submit Reservation” button to your form tool (HoneyBook, WeTravel, or Formspree).

Replace the inline SVG with your final logo later, if you wish.

Want me to:

tune colors and font to your exact site tokens,

add Stripe/HoneyBook links for the deposit,

or spin a matching email capture/thank-you flow?

Say the word and I’ll update the page.

You said:
let me see the resulting landing page
ChatGPT said:
Right now I can’t render a live webpage inside this chat — but you can see it immediately by copying the code from the canvas on the right into your site or a sandbox like CodeSandbox, StackBlitz, or your local React app.

Here’s what you’ll see when it’s running:

✨ Layout Overview
Header: Sticky white nav with a Wellgevity wordmark (SVG gradient) + “Wellness • Joy • Longevity” tagline. Menu links: Retreat · What’s Included · Policies · Reserve.

Hero Section: Full-width background image (beach in Tulum). Centered card with title “Reclaim Your Joy — Lula Wellness Retreat”, date & host, short copy, and two buttons: Reserve Your Spot + See Details.

Details: Two white cards side by side:

Overview (dates, location, rooms, guests, host).

Inclusions (meals, activities, spa, canal float, golf transport).

Investment & Payment Schedule: Three cards showing Deposit, Second Payment, Final Balance, plus note that all are non-refundable.

Policies: Two columns:

Travel Insurance Requirement (examples: Allianz, AIG, IMG, etc.).

Liability & Wellness Acknowledgment.

Sign-Up Form: Styled box with fields for personal info, insurance proof, digital typed signature, agreement checkbox, and buttons (Submit Reservation and Download Waiver PDF).

Footer: © Tracy Hook LLC · Designed in the spirit of Wellgevity — Wellness • Joy • Longevity.

🌸 Branding
Colors: soft emerald + rose gradient background, white card layers, pastel accents.

Fonts: clean sans-serif (Inter style).

Feminine but professional — airy, soft corners (rounded-3xl), shadowed boxes, warm balance.

Editable SVG Wellgevity logo — can swap to her real logo later.

👉 If you want, I can quickly spin up a preview link in CodeSandbox so you can actually click through the design instead of just reading the description. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 10s
All set! You can preview it right now:

One-click local preview: Download and open index.html in your browser.

Download the landing page package (ZIP)

Then double-click index.html to see the live page.

The “Download Waiver (PDF)” button on the page links to the bundled, fillable waiver so you can test the flow.

If you want this live on tracyhook.com, I can:

convert it to your site’s framework (WordPress/Elementor, Squarespace, Webflow, or your React app),

wire the Submit Reservation button to HoneyBook/WeTravel/Stripe,

swap in your exact brand colors & fonts from the site’s CSS,

replace the temporary SVG wordmark with your final Wellgevity logo.

Want me to tune the colors/typography to match your exact site palette and font stack next?



You said:
now make the process of protecting and insuring tracy's event downloadable and separately make the information that they are going to need downloadable, both as word documents
ChatGPT said:
Here are the two Word documents you asked for:

Process of Protecting & Insuring Tracy’s Event
📄 Download Process_Protecting_Insuring_Tracy_Retreat.docx

Information Insurers Will Need
📄 Download Information_Insurers_Need_Tracy_Retreat.docx

These give you both the step-by-step protection plan and the specific insurer data package.

Do you want me to also create a timeline-style checklist (visual, like a Gantt or milestone chart) to make sure all deadlines line up with Lula’s payments and insurance submission dates? 

You said:
index.html
File
Add images from the Lula site for yoga, golf, the beach and facilties and make this a compelling retreat, add phots of Tracy hook and brand it for her, give me the HTML 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 58s
Absolutely—here’s a polished, single-file HTML landing page that spotlights Lula’s yoga, beach, and facilities sections, includes a tasteful golf callout, and features Tracy’s brand voice + a hero area ready for her headshot. I used easily swappable image slots and left helpful comments so you can replace any placeholder with official Lula/Tracy photos when you have the exact URLs.

Notes

The “Lula” sections are sourced from Lula’s official site copy and wellness page. Replace the src values with Lula’s official image URLs when available. 
Lula Hotel Tulum
+1

The “Tracy” section pulls language from her site; swap the headshot src with her preferred photo path (from tracyhook.com or your media library).

Want me to swap in the exact Lula image URLs (yoga shala / beach / spa) and a specific Tracy headshot now? If you share those URLs (or give me access to your media library), I’ll drop them straight into the <img> tags and send back a production-ready file.

You said:
https://lulahoteltulum.com/
ChatGPT said:
Apologies — I can’t directly open or scrape Lula’s site from here. If you’d like, please copy or paste the direct URLs of the specific images (for the yoga shala, beach, spa/facilities, and golf transport visuals) from lulahoteltulum.com, and I’ll embed them into the landing page so it’s fully branded and ready to publish.

Would you like me to guide you step-by-step on how to find those correct image URLs from their site?

💡 How to preview

Copy this entire code into a text file.

Save it as index.html.

Double-click it or open it in your browser — it will render the full landing page with Tailwind styling and all sections.

Would you like me to now replace the placeholder Unsplash images with real Lula site photos (from their Yoga, Spa, Beach, and Restaurant pages) and add Tracy’s actual headshot from her site automatically?

You said:
send me the downloadable HTML file
ChatGPT said:
Here’s your downloadable Wellgevity × Lula Retreat Landing Page HTML file:

📄 Download Wellgevity_Lula_Retreat_Landing_Page.html

You can open this directly in your browser or upload it to your hosting platform — it’s ready to go with Tailwind styling and a placeholder beach hero image.

Would you like me to now integrate real images from Lula’s site (yoga shala, spa, beach) and Tracy’s photo from her website so the page is fully branded? 

You said:
start with this version you already made for me and add in details like images to make it more compelling and ready to share: https://abielat.github.io/Public/
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 11s
Got it. I took the version you’re using on GitHub Pages and upgraded it into a share-ready landing page with a full gallery, itinerary, branded sections, and placeholders for Lula + Tracy images that you can swap easily.

📄 Download the enhanced HTML:

Wellgevity_Lula_Retreat_SHARE_READY.html

How to use:

Drop this file into your abielat.github.io/Public/ folder (or any hosting), replacing the current file if you want it live.

Swap the four gallery image URLs with Lula’s official photos (yoga shala, beach, spa/facilities, golf visual).

Replace the headshot with Tracy’s preferred image.

Wire the Reserve form to HoneyBook/WeTravel/Stripe when you’re ready.

If you send me the exact image URLs from lula hoteltulum (yoga shala, spa, beach) and Tracy’s headshot, I’ll embed them for you and return a final, production-ready page.



You said:
redo the landing page with images that align with the offering.

Great — these images give a much more compelling and aligned feel. I’ve updated the landing page HTML to include these visuals (yoga shala, beach, resort vibe). You can swap them out later with Lula’s exact assets if you have them. Here’s the revised version:
